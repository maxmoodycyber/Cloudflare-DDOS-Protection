This will send a captcha/challenge to these specific regions when they access your website. Super useful as either an alternative to geoblocking or as a second line of defence.

Setup:
1] Create a firewall rule
2] Paste the blocklist below into the expressions
3] Edit to your liking
4] Set the firewall action to either legacy captcha or managed challenge (either should work)

Blocklist:
(ip.geoip.country eq "CA") or (ip.geoip.country eq "US") or (ip.geoip.country eq "GB") or (ip.geoip.country eq "FI") or (ip.geoip.country eq "NL") or (ip.geoip.country eq "AN") or (ip.geoip.country eq "PL")
